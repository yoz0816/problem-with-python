# Phase 8: Shadowing & Naming Conflicts

## Your task

- Create a dummy module named `list.py` that shadows built-in list
- Write a script that fails due to shadowing
- Fix it using `import builtins` and `builtins.list`
- Rename your dummy module to a professional name and explain why renaming is better

## Tips

- Shadowing can cause very confusing bugs
- Avoid naming local modules with names of built-in functions or standard libraries
