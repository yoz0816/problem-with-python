# Phase 6: Package Creation

## Your task

- Create a folder named `shopping_cart`
- Move your existing modules (`cart.py`, `products.py`, etc.) into this folder
- Create `__init__.py` that imports and exposes core functions
- Test imports from the package in a separate script

## Tips

- Remember relative imports when modules move into package folder
- Make sure your imports inside modules are adjusted accordingly
- Try `from shopping_cart import create_cart` in Python shell to verify
